# Paint-Calculator
"""Calculates the floor area and amount of paint needed usingthe parameters Length Width Height Paint Coverage and using unittest to make sure there were no errors when run."""
this is a very basic example of a paint calculator and given extra time i would add some additional features.
for example if it was a widely used function you may need to implement some kind of unit converters for example metric(meters) to imperial(feet).
